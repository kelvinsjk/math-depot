  <p>
    We house a collection of answers for the
    Singapore SEAB A Levels O and A Mathematics Examinations.
  </p>
  <p>
    Compared to other solutions out there,
    the solutions here are designed to be digital friendly
    (works on both mobile and larger screens) and are coded with the help
    of computer technology.

	<p>
		We aim to produce random variations of the past examination questions to
		give students even more practice on the core skills needed to ace their examinations.
		Stay tuned for future updates.
